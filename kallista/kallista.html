<p> Yuki Li, aged 22, is a transfer student from China and on her first semester at California College of the Arts to
  study Graphic Design. Her first experience with Web Design is at Diablo Valley College, where she took an
  introductory class. She loves making graphic arts during her free time and even taught herself to work with
  Photoshop. Most of her experience with graphic design were through exploring the softwares by herself, before she
  took graphic design classes at Diablo Valley College. Yuki had work experience to do photo edits, book cover design,
  logo design and calligraphy for her friends.

<p><b> How does the web affect graphic design (negatively or positively)?</p></b>

<p> In my opinion, web design make graphic design more rich and more possibilities and opportunities, because web
  design is really different from designing on designing for printed materials. I think the advantages of design online
  is saving time and easier to remake/redesign, because if the printed material is designed for wrong, it's hard and
  waste time to redo.</p>

<p><b>Would you agree that design online is more effective than print design? Why?
  </b></p>

<p> I do not agree, even though as technology develop, most of the people choose surfing on internet instead of going
  to library or bookstore, but seems like even though we
  can search all the artwork from all over the world, we still need to go gallery or museum to close to them and visit,
  feeling in real. So I think web design and printed design are equal.
  But I think designing for online work is effective, because people can get what they want really quickly through
  search engine/Ai and so on in order to save time.
</p>

<p><b>What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of web design?</b></p>

<p> Advantages would be low maintenance, brand consistency, usability and load time. Disadvantages are development
  time, different devices, limited support and navigation menus.
</p>

<p><b> How do you think does the internet has changed over time? And what are your opinions/experiences through the
    change?
  </b></p>

<p> Through looking through the change from internet as technique develop, I can understand that the technique and
  inventions are make effect both for web designer and readers, designer can save their time through designing into
  different convenience tools and readers can read more easier and search easier and clear online through different way
  from computer or mobile phone. And web site develop more like book and is decorated more and more 'colorful' and
  rich.</p>

<p><b> What is the most important aspect of a successful screen-based design?</b></p>

<p> If it is readable or not, I think this is the most important things when I started to design a web. If the website
  have complete functions, for example, search engines, menu(navigation), logo. Also how to control space is really
  important, for example, fold the document into navigation is really good idea, seems like the word 'hierarchy'. Site
  speed an Absolute Priority, It's probably one of the least debated facts in the web design sphere that speed is
  important, research has shown that it influences everything from bounce rate over user satisfaction to conversions
  and revenue. Color scheme and Typeset also typography is essential too, because those choose are make effect to
  'readable'. If the website is a function website for client, it must be according to client's requirements and
  website purpose to design, let readers can understand what kind of website they are looking about within few seconds.
  If the website is a responsive website or not, because these days, more and more people using mobile phone to search
  instead of computer, so nowadays, if the website can change size and fit with phone screen size is really important.</p>

<p><b>Do you agree that graphic designers should have web design skills?</b></p>

<p>In my opinion, I agree, I think as the time develop, science(surwares)develop and grow, designers should try their
  best to follow the era trend. When people invent paper and print, people start to think learning typesetting and
  typography, so I think, in our century, most people use website through computer or phone to know news and so on, so
  I think graphic designer cannot just know how to design on printed medium, but also screen medium.
</p>

<p><b>Do you think the advancement of technology will benefit web designers?</b></p>

<p>Yes, nowadays, as the century and science develop, web designers is benefit by a lot of technology, for example,
  people using different software to do template in order to do plan with website, also html, css, java editor, and
  people can using photoshop, illustrator or Indesign more easier to design for their logo and so on, I think in the
  future, artificial intelligence can help web designers more.</p>
